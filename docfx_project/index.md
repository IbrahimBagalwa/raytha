## What does Raytha excel at?
Raytha CMS is an ideal platform when you need to build a .NET web application with CleanArchitecture principles that also require login/authentication/RBAC. The platform comes with built-in features like audit logs, content management, and a UI pattern, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than building common features from scratch.

Some of the key benefits of using Raytha CMS include:

* Faster development time due to the pre-built features and tools.
* A consistent and standardized architecture that enables easier maintenance and scalability.
* Improved security features such as built-in authentication and authorization.
* Act as both an integrated and Headless CMS.

In summary, if you need to build a .NET web application with CleanArchitecture principles and require login/authentication/RBAC functionality, Raytha CMS could be the perfect platform for you.

## When should you avoid Raytha CMS?
While Raytha CMS is a great platform for many use cases, it may not be the best fit for every project. Consider avoiding Raytha CMS if:

* Your project doesn't require any login/authentication/RBAC functionality.
* You are building a simple microservice that doesn't require a full-fledged web application framework.
* You are prohibited from using the [CleanArchitecture pattern](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture).
